how NumPy array and list are different ?
-----------------------------------------

-> Python Lists

	-> Data Types: Can hold mixed data types (e.g., integers, strings).

	-> Performance: Slower for numerical operations.

	-> Functionality: Basic operations (append, slice), no built-in math functions.

	-> Memory: Less memory-efficient.

	-> Multidimensional: Nest lists to create multidimensional structures, but less intuitive.

-> NumPy Arrays

	-> Data Types: Must be of the same data type (homogeneous).

	-> Performance: Fast for numerical operations with vectorization.

	-> Functionality: Rich set of mathematical and array-specific functions.

	-> Memory: More memory-efficient with fixed-size data types.

	-> Multidimensional: Native support for multidimensional arrays (e.g., matrices).

Classification Models  :- For classification problems, where the goal is to predict discrete labels (e.g., yes/no, cat/dog):

	
	Logistic Regression: Used for binary classification problems.

	K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Simple and intuitive method for both binary and multi-class classification.
	
	Support Vector Machines (SVM): Effective in high-dimensional spaces; good for binary and multi-class classification.
	
	Decision Trees: Non-linear model that is easy to interpret.
	
	Random Forest: Ensemble method that reduces overfitting by averaging multiple decision trees.
	
	Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM): Ensemble method that builds models sequentially to correct errors from previous models.

	Naive Bayes: Based on Bayes' theorem; works well with small datasets and for text classification.

	Neural Networks: Powerful models that can capture complex patterns; used for both binary and multi-class classification.

	XGBoost: An optimized implementation of gradient boosting, often used in machine learning competitions.


Regression Models :- For regression problems, where the goal is to predict continuous values


	Linear Regression: Simple model to predict a continuous target variable.
	
	Polynomial Regression: Extends linear regression by considering polynomial terms.
	
	Ridge Regression: Regularized version of linear regression to prevent overfitting.

	Lasso Regression: Another regularized version that can reduce the number of features.

	Support Vector Regression (SVR): Extension of SVM for regression tasks.

	Decision Trees: Can also be used for regression by predicting continuous values.

	Random Forest: Ensemble method that reduces overfitting and variance.

	Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM): Builds models sequentially to improve predictions.

	Neural Networks: Powerful models for capturing complex relationships in data.

	XGBoost: Optimized gradient boosting implementation that works well for regression.
